This directory is here to hold experiment specific files that we don't want
tracked by Github. These include log files and settings files. These files are
convenient to store in the directory structure of the project, but shouldn't 
pollute folders with project code. So they get put here, and the .gitignore file
makes sure the never see the light of the remote repository.
