12/20/19 I made this file so that i can have something inconsequential to edit so that I can test pushing to github. - Preston

Still shows that Minho made the commit on Github, despite changing the credentials in Windows Cred Manager and in the terminal.

I changed the config file to reflect that the proper user was pushing to the git repository. It now correctly shows up on Git that I made the changes, and not Minho.
