'''The DDS class for accessing functionality of the ../DDS.py controller

Example usage:

### set up the DDS channels to use the DDS class for grey coding ###
# Alias the the profile() method of each of these instances, for convenience.
MOT = DDS(
    HSDIO,                                      # pass in HSDIO function so it can be used in the class
    (32, 33, 34),                               # HSDIO channels for profile pins
    {                                           # dict with channel descriptions and pin settings
        'MOT':(0,0,0),
        'PGC in MOT':(1,0,0),
        'off':(0,1,0),
